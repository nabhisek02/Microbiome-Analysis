# To get a species-level count of taxa in your sequence analysis using QIIME 2, you will 
need to process your taxonomy classification results. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Taxonomic Classification
Ensure that you have already classified your sequences using a feature classifier 
(like Greengenes or SILVA). This step provides you with a taxonomy.qza file.

2. Export the Taxonomy Data
First, export the taxonomy data from the taxonomy.qza file:

# qiime tools export \
  --input-path taxonomy.qza \
  --output-path exported-taxonomy

3. Convert the Taxonomy Data to a TSV File
The exported taxonomy data will be in a QIIME 2-specific format. You need to convert it 
into a TSV (Tab Separated Values) file:

# biom convert \
  -i exported-taxonomy/feature-table.biom \
  -o exported-taxonomy/feature-table.tsv \
  --to-tsv

4. Processing the TSV File for Species Count
You can now process the TSV file to count the unique species. This can be done using a scripting 
language like Python:

###
import pandas as pd

# Load the TSV file
taxonomy_df = pd.read_csv('exported-taxonomy/taxonomy.tsv', sep='\t', header=None)

# Extract the species information
# Assuming the last column contains the taxonomy string
taxonomy_df['species'] = taxonomy_df.iloc[:, -1].str.extract('s__([^;]+)')

# Count unique species
unique_species = taxonomy_df['species'].nunique()

print(f"Number of unique species: {unique_species}")
In this script, we extract the species information from the taxonomy string. The species name is 
typically indicated by 's__' in the taxonomy string.

5. Notes:
Replace 'exported-taxonomy/taxonomy.tsv' with your actual file path.

The accuracy of species-level identification depends on the quality of your sequencing data 
and the reference database used for classification. Some sequences might not be classified down 
to the species level, which is common in microbial community analysis due to limitations in 
current reference databases and the resolution of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This approach will give 
you an approximate count of the different species present in your samples as identified by your 
chosen classifier.
